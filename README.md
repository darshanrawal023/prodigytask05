Analyzing Traffic Accident Data for Safer Roads 
I recently worked on an insightful project analyzing traffic accident data to uncover patterns linked to road conditions, weather, and time of day. Through data visualization, I identified accident hotspots and contributing factors, offering valuable insights for improving road safety.

This project not only enhanced my skills in data analysis and visualization but also reinforced the importance of data-driven solutions for societal challenges.

Looking forward to applying these insights further and collaborating on impactful initiatives!
